     Reads a `String` field from AR container. The end of the field is defined by either:
     1. NULL or SPACE character (thus CString in the name of the function).
     2. Reaching specified maximum length.

     Strings are encoded in AR using ASCII encoding. We are treating them as UTF-8 encoded instead since UTF-8 is
     backwards compatible with ASCII.

     We use `String(cString:)` initalizer because AR's NULL-ending ASCII fields are basically CStrings (especially,
     since we are treating them as UTF-8 strings). As a bonus, this initializer is not failable: it replaces unparsable
     as UTF-8 sequences of bytes with UTF-8 Replacement Character, so we don't need to throw any error.
